# Agent Circle — Vision

## Overview

Agent Circle is an experimental research intelligence system developed under the PaperSupe ecosystem. It is designed as a **single agentic AI** whose primary purpose is to *read*, *understand*, and *connect* academic research — not to chat, not to automate actions, and not to speculate beyond grounded knowledge.

Agent Circle evolves slowly and deliberately. Capabilities are unlocked only when supported by sufficient understanding and structure.

> **Principle:** Understanding precedes interaction.

## What Agent Circle Is

Agent Circle is:

* A **research reading agent** capable of ingesting academic papers
* A **conceptual reasoning system** that extracts and links ideas across domains
* A **grounded intelligence layer** built on retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)
* A **long-lived research memory**, not a conversational assistant

It focuses on:

* Core arguments
* Assumptions
* Methods
* Theoretical frameworks
* Relationships between papers

---

## What Agent Circle Is Not

Agent Circle is **not**:

* A general-purpose chatbot
* A search engine replacement
* An action-executing agent
* A speculative or creative writing system
* A live Q&A system (yet)

Any interaction that is not grounded in ingested research is explicitly out of scope.

## Core Design Principles

### 1. Grounded Intelligence

All reasoning performed by the agent must be grounded in an explicit research corpus. If knowledge is not present, the agent does not infer or fabricate.

> No paper → no opinion.

---

### 2. Single-Agent Focus

Agent Circle intentionally begins as a **single agent** system. This allows:

* Clear reasoning chains
* Traceable understanding
* Reduced emergent behavior
* Easier evaluation of intelligence growth

Multi-agent architectures may be explored in the future, but only after the single-agent foundation proves stable and interpretable.

---

### 3. Reading Before Responding

The agent prioritizes:

1. Reading
2. Extracting meaning
3. Structuring concepts
4. Linking ideas

Only after these steps are reliable does the system move toward answering questions.

---

### 4. Concept-Level Reasoning

Rather than operating at the level of text similarity or summaries, Agent Circle reasons over:

* Concepts
* Relationships
* Dependencies
* Contradictions
* Lineages of ideas

This enables cross-paper and cross-domain insight rather than surface-level recall.

---

### 5. Capability Gating

Agent Circle evolves through **explicit capability stages**. Each stage is locked behind technical and epistemic readiness.

Current stage:

* **Status:** Experimental
* **Mode:** Reading-only

Future stages are defined in the roadmap and unlocked incrementally.

---

## Relationship to PaperSupe

Agent Circle is both:

* An **independent system** with its own architecture and interface
* A **reusable intelligence layer** that PaperSupe can integrate

PaperSupe may surface Agent Circle capabilities through:

* Sub-pages
* Embedded interfaces
* API-driven features

However, Agent Circle remains decoupled to preserve experimental freedom and architectural clarity.

---

## Long-Term Vision

The long-term goal of Agent Circle is to become:

* A reliable research reasoning engine
* A conceptual map of evolving academic knowledge
* A system that assists researchers in understanding *what is known*, *how it connects*, and *where uncertainty remains*

Not faster answers — **better understanding**.

---

## Guiding Statement

Agent Circle grows alongside its research foundation.

Capabilities expand only when grounded in understanding.
