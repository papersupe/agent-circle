A.2 MoreRelatedWorksonReasoningandScientificDiscovery
This paper is a successive work in inductive reasoning and is different from commonsense reason-
ing(Bosselutetal.,2019;Yangetal.,2020)inthatthenovelsocialsciencehypothesesdonotbelongto
commonsense.
Case-based reasoning (Das et al., 2021; Yang et al., 2023a) also falls in the domain of inductive
reasoning, but case-based reasoning is more about high-level guidance on methodology design (case

A.10 MoreDetailsAboutPast-FeedbackDesign
In practice, we find that ChatGPT is not capable enough to generate past-feedback with enough good
quality for the Inspiration Feedback module. Instead, it tends to provide feedback as “the previous
inspirationtitlesarenotveryrelevanttothehypothesesorthebackground”. Asaresult,theChatGPT
InspirationTitleFindermoduletendstoselectinspirationtitlesthatareveryrelatedtothebackground,
resultinginalessnovelhypothesesgeneration.
ThereforeinsteadofinstantiatingwithChatGPTfortheInspirationFeedbackmodule,weexperiment
with leveraging human heuristics. The heuristics are “if the inspiration titles are less related to the
background, then more novel hypotheses are likely to be proposed.”. With this heuristics-based past-
feedback,MOOSEdoesperformbetter(asshowninthetablesin§5and§6).
Thisheuristics-basedfeedbackispossibletobeobtainedbyalanguagemodelsinceithasaccessto

Hypothesis 1: The level of personalization in crowdfunding campaign storytelling, the influence of
social media influencers who align with the campaign, the presence of trust indicators, and the emo-
tional appeal of the campaign will positively impact potential donors’ likelihood of making a do-
nation. Additionally, the timing of donation requests and the type of social media influencers (e.g.,
celebrities vs. micro-influencers) will moderate this relationship. The perceived risk associated with
the crowdfunding campaign will negatively moderate the relationship between the emotional appeal
and donation likelihood. (Validness: 4.5; Novelty: 4.5; Helpfulness: 4.5)
Hypothesis 2: Limited financial resources and limited access to networks and markets of women
entrepreneurs in the manufacturing sector in developing countries may negatively impact their in-
vestment in corporate social responsibility (CSR) initiatives that promote gender equality in host
countries. This relationship is further influenced by the intersectionality of gender and race, with
women of color facing additional challenges. Additionally, the hypothesis considers the role of insti-
tutional factors, such as legal frameworks and policies, and the influence of patriarchal structures
on women entrepreneurs’ ability to invest in CSR initiatives. (Validness: 3.5; Novelty: 4.0; Helpful-
